## Guidelines for sample street addresses, telephone numbers, and emails for sample data generation 



- **Street addresses**: you should use sequential numbers, common street names, and incorrect zip codes (e.g., 4567 Main St Buffalo, NY 98052).

- **Telephone numbers**: in the United States, the phone number 555-0100 to 555-0199 may be used with any North American area code (except 800, 866, 877, 888, or 900).  International phone numbers should use sequential numbers.

- Email Addresses

  If you need to use a fictitious email address, please follow the guidelines below to avoid the potential for unintended mail being sent to real email addresses. If you do not wish to create one, the fictitious email address **someone@example.com** is reserved for sample purposes.
   
  
  - If you want the fictitious email address to correspond with a fictitious domain name from the pre-approved list, use only a first name for the username (example: john@contoso.com).
  - If the email address corresponds with a fictitious domain name that you are creating, please be sure the domain name follows the fictitious domain name guidelines. Use only a first name for the username (example: john@widgets!inc.widgets).
  - If the username needs to be unique to a particular country or region, please use the [Fictitious Names Finder tool](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/celaweb-tools/sitepages/fictitiousnamefinder.aspx) and associated [FAQ](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/CELAWeb-Copyrights-Trademarks-And-Patents/sitepages/trademarks-fictitious-names-finder-faq.aspx) and follow the above points depending on the fictitious domain name chosen.
