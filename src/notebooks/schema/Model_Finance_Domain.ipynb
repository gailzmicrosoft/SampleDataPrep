    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook creates Finance domain tables that integrate with shared master data from the Sales domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Achievements\n",
    "- **Domain-driven design**: Finance-specific business logic\n",
    "- **Shared master data**: References Customer, Product tables from Sales domain\n",
    "- **Clean integration**: Links to Sales Order data via foreign keys\n",
    "- **Enterprise-ready**: Proper accounting and financial tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schema Structure\n",
    "- **Finance Domain**: 4 tables (Account, Invoice, Payment, Transaction)\n",
    "- **Integration**: Links to shared Customer, Product, Order tables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "- **Prerequisite**: Run Customer_Product_Order_Simplified_12.ipynb first\n",
    "- **Shared Tables**: Customer, Product, Order (created by Sales domain)\n",
