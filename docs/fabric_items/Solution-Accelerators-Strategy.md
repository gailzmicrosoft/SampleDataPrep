Accelerators 
- Production-ready for public GitHub publication
- Reliable for customer/partner demos
- Showcase end-to-end Fabric capabilities
- Work consistently for sales demonstrations

Given this context, your two-solution approach makes complete sense:

## üéØ **Solution Accelerator Strategy**

### **Solution 1: Unified Data Platform Foundation**
**Purpose**: Demonstrate core Fabric capabilities and patterns
**Audience**: Technical architects, data engineers, platform builders
**Value**: Show how to build robust, scalable data platforms on Fabric

### **Solution 2: Industry Use Case (Retail)**
**Purpose**: Show business value built on the platform
**Audience**: Business stakeholders, industry specialists, sales scenarios
**Value**: Demonstrate tangible ROI and industry-specific insights

## ü§î **Strategic Decision Points**

### **For Solution 1 (Platform Foundation):**
- Should definitely use **proven, stable Fabric features**
- Bronze-Silver-Gold medallion architecture
- Your existing outdoor retail data works perfectly
- Focus on data engineering excellence, not industry specifics

### **For Solution 2 (Retail Use Case):**
This is where your retail industry data model concerns are most relevant:

**Option A: Use Fabric Retail Industry Solution**
- ‚úÖ Official Microsoft industry solution
- ‚úÖ Shows latest Fabric retail capabilities
- ‚ùå Stability risks you've experienced
- ‚ùå Complex referential integrity blocking demos
- ‚ùå Risk of demo failures due to preview limitations

**Option B: Custom Retail Analytics on Stable Platform**
- ‚úÖ Built on proven Solution 1 foundation
- ‚úÖ Reliable for demos and customer presentations
- ‚úÖ Shows real business value without beta risks
- ‚úÖ You control the demo experience
- ‚ùå Not showcasing official industry solution

## üí≠ **Questions for Your Decision**

### **Timeline Considerations:**
- When do you need this published and demo-ready?
- Can you afford to rebuild if the retail industry solution changes?
- How important is it to showcase the "latest" vs "most reliable"?

### **Audience Priorities:**
- Are customers asking specifically about Fabric's retail industry solutions?
- Or are they more interested in general Fabric platform capabilities?
- Will sales teams be comfortable explaining custom vs. industry solution approaches?

### **Risk Tolerance:**
- How much demo failure risk can you accept for solution accelerators?
- Is it better to show stable capabilities or cutting-edge features?
- What happens if Microsoft significantly changes the retail industry solution after you publish?

## üéØ **My Recommendation for Solution Accelerators**

Given the GitHub publication and demo requirements, I'd suggest:

**Solution 1**: Definitely use the **stable unified platform approach** with your existing data
**Solution 2**: Consider **custom retail analytics** built on Solution 1's foundation rather than the preview industry solution

This gives you:
- Reliable demos that won't fail
- Full control over the customer experience  
- Ability to show impressive retail insights without beta risks
- Easy maintenance and updates

What's your instinct on the risk/reward tradeoff for the retail use case? Are you leaning toward showcasing the official industry solution despite the risks, or building something more reliable?
