I am still exploring the Fabric Retail Data Models. Looks like i have tables in silver tier, not in Bronze or Gold Tier. I need to do a quick experiement, I have created a SQL server in Fabric workspace with the name of Gaiye-SQL-DB It has  two schemas, dbo, and SalesLT. I'd like to export all the tables with SalesLT schema to my Fabric retail data model bronze layer. what do I need to do, just the steps, no code yet.



Great! You want to experiment by exporting tables from your Fabric SQL Database to the retail data model bronze layer. Here are the steps you'll need to follow:

## ðŸ“‹ **Steps to Export SQL Tables to Fabric Retail Bronze Layer**

### **Step 1: Identify Source Tables**
- Connect to your `Gaiye-SQL-DB` in Fabric
- List all tables in the `SalesLT` schema
- Document table structures and relationships
- Note any data dependencies between tables

### **Step 2: Access Fabric Retail Data Model**
- Navigate to your Fabric workspace
- Locate your retail data model lakehouse
- Confirm the bronze layer folder structure exists
- Check current bronze layer contents (if any)

### **Step 3: Choose Export Method**
**Option A: Data Pipeline Approach**
- Create a new Data Pipeline in Fabric
- Use "Copy Data" activity
- Source: Your SQL Database (SalesLT schema)
- Destination: Retail data model bronze layer

**Option B: Notebook Approach**
- Create a Fabric notebook
- Connect to SQL database using connection strings
- Query SalesLT tables and write to bronze layer
- Handle data types and schema mapping

**Option C: Dataflow Gen2 Approach**
- Use Dataflow Gen2 for visual data movement
- Configure SQL source connection
- Map to bronze layer destinations

### **Step 4: Handle Schema Mapping**
- Map SalesLT table structures to retail bronze format
- Decide on file formats (Parquet, Delta, CSV)
- Plan for any necessary data type conversions
- Consider partitioning strategies if needed

### **Step 5: Configure Data Movement**
- Set up incremental vs. full load strategy
- Configure scheduling if needed for ongoing sync
- Plan for error handling and monitoring
- Test with a small table first

### **Step 6: Validate Results**
- Verify data landed in bronze layer correctly
- Check row counts and data quality
- Confirm file formats and folder structure
- Test downstream consumption from bronze

## ðŸ¤” **Key Decisions Needed**

**Data Movement Frequency:**
- One-time export or ongoing sync?
- Full refresh or incremental updates?

**File Format Choice:**
- Parquet (recommended for analytics)
- Delta Lake (if you need ACID transactions)
- CSV (simplest but less efficient)

**Table Selection:**
- Export all SalesLT tables or specific ones?
- Handle table dependencies in correct order?

**Naming Convention:**
- Keep SalesLT table names or map to retail model names?
- Add prefixes/suffixes for source identification?

Which export method appeals to you most, and do you want to start with all SalesLT tables or focus on specific ones first?
