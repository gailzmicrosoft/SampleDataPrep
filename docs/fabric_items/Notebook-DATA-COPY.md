Perfect! The notebook method is ideal for a one-time export to get sample data into your retail data model bronze layer. Here are the detailed steps for the notebook approach:

## ðŸ““ **Notebook Method Details**

### **Step 1: Create Fabric Notebook**
- In your Fabric workspace, create a new Notebook
- Choose Python as the language
- Ensure it has access to your lakehouse (attach the retail data model lakehouse)

### **Step 2: Establish SQL Database Connection**
- Use Fabric's built-in SQL connectivity
- Connect to your `Gaiye-SQL-DB` database
- Authentication will use your Fabric workspace credentials

### **Step 3: Query SalesLT Schema Tables**
- First, discover all tables in SalesLT schema
- Then iterate through each table to extract data
- Handle any data type conversions needed

### **Step 4: Write to Bronze Layer**
- Save each table as Parquet files in bronze layer
- Maintain original table names for easy identification
- Add metadata like extraction timestamp

### **Step 5: Validate Export**
- Check row counts match between source and destination
- Verify file creation in bronze layer
- Test reading the exported data

## ðŸ”§ **Key Technical Considerations**

### **Connection Method:**
- Use `%%sql` magic commands for direct SQL queries
- Or use `pyodbc`/`sqlalchemy` for more control
- Fabric provides built-in SQL database connectivity

### **Data Handling:**
- Read each table into pandas DataFrame
- Handle potential memory issues for large tables
- Convert data types as needed for downstream processing

### **File Storage:**
- Save as Parquet format (efficient, preserves schema)
- Organize in bronze layer folder structure
- Include table metadata and lineage information

### **Error Handling:**
- Handle tables that might be empty
- Manage connection timeouts
- Log any data conversion issues

### **Performance Optimization:**
- Process tables in parallel if needed
- Use chunking for very large tables
- Optimize Spark settings if using PySpark

## ðŸ“Š **Typical Notebook Structure**

The notebook would typically have these sections:

1. **Setup & Imports** - Import necessary libraries
2. **Database Connection** - Connect to Gaiye-SQL-DB
3. **Schema Discovery** - List all SalesLT tables
4. **Data Export Loop** - Extract each table to bronze
5. **Validation** - Verify successful export
6. **Summary Report** - Show what was exported

## ðŸ¤” **Questions to Clarify**

**Table Selection:**
- Do you want all SalesLT tables or can you specify which ones?
- Any tables you want to exclude or prioritize?

**File Organization:**
- Should each table go to a separate folder in bronze?
- Any specific naming convention preferences?

**Data Processing:**
- Any immediate data cleaning needed during export?
- Should we preserve original data types or optimize for analytics?

Would you like me to create the notebook for you, or do you want to try building it yourself with guidance on specific sections?
