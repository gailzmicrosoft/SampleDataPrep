You're absolutely right! Let me check the current notebook state and then identify what tables might be missing from the Fabric Retail data model.

Retrieving Notebook summary.

Now let me look at the schema discovery cell (Cell 3) to see what dependencies were identified for the 8 Phase 1 tables:

Read [Silver_Data_Generation_Fixed.ipynb](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/gazho/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html), lines 180 to 280

Now let me look at the errors more closely. The issue seems to be field merging conflicts. Let me check what specific errors we're getting and if there are missing dependent tables. Let me search for any references to foreign keys or dependencies:

Searched text for `PHASE1_TARGET_TABLES` (`**/Silver_Data_Generation_Fixed.ipynb`), 6 results

Based on the error messages you shared, I can see the pattern. The errors are:

1. **`[DELTA_FAILED_TO_MERGE_FIELDS] Failed to merge fields 'GlobalLocationNumber' and 'GlobalLocationNumber'`** - This suggests there are schema conflicts, not missing tables
2. **`[CANNOT_DETERMINE_TYPE] Some of types cannot be determined after inferring`** - This happens when we have `None` values in fields where Spark can't determine the type
3. **`[CANNOT_MERGE_TYPE] Can not merge type LongType and DoubleType`** - This is a data type mismatch issue

The issue isn't missing **tables** - all 8 tables exist in your Fabric Retail data model. The issue is missing **reference data** that these tables depend on. Let me analyze what lookup/reference tables the 8 Phase 1 tables are likely referencing:

**Likely Missing Reference Tables:**

1. **PartyType** - Referenced by `Party.PartyTypeId`
2. **CustomerType** - Referenced by `Customer.CustomerTypeId`
3. **ResponsibilityCenter** - Referenced by `Customer.ResponsibilityCenterId`
4. **Ledger** - Referenced by `Customer.LedgerId`
5. **State/Province** - Referenced by `Location.LocationStateId`
6. **Country** - Referenced by `Location.CountryId`
7. **Subdivision** - Referenced by `Location.SubdivisionId`
8. **Timezone** - Referenced by `Location.TimezoneId`
9. **UnitOfMeasure** - Referenced by `Location.LocationElevationUnitOfMeasureId`

**For Order/OrderLine/Invoice/InvoiceLine, there are likely many more dependencies:**

- OrderType, OrderStatus, PaymentMethod, Currency, Product, ProductCategory, TaxType, etc.

The real issue is that **we're generating data with foreign key values that don't exist in the reference tables**, causing the merge conflicts.

**Questions to clarify:**

1. **Should we first populate the reference/lookup tables** (PartyType, CustomerType, etc.) before loading the main 8 tables?
2. **Should we use existing reference data** that's already in your lakehouse, or generate our own reference data?
3. **Should we modify our data generation to use `NULL` values** for foreign keys instead of made-up values?

What approach would you prefer? Should I run Cell 2 first to see exactly which reference tables exist in your 57-table structure?
