## **1. Identity and Access Management**

### **Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for Authentication**
- Use **Azure AD identities** for accessing Azure Storage instead of shared keys or SAS tokens.
- Assign **Azure RBAC roles** to users, groups, or managed identities to enforce least privilege access.

### **Disable Shared Key Access**
- Disable shared key authentication to prevent unauthorized access using storage account keys.
- Set `allowSharedKeyAccess` to `false` in your Bicep or ARM templates.

**Example**:
```bicep
allowSharedKeyAccess: false
```

### **Use Managed Identities**
- Use **Managed Identities** for applications and services to securely access Azure Storage without managing credentials.

---

## **2. Network Security**

### **Restrict Public Network Access**
- Disable public network access to the storage account unless absolutely necessary.
- Use **private endpoints** to connect securely to Azure Storage over a private network.

**Example**:
```bicep
publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'
```

### **Enable Virtual Network Integration**
- Use **Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints** or **private endpoints** to restrict access to Azure Storage from specific VNets.

### **Firewall Rules**
- Configure **firewall rules** to allow access only from trusted IP ranges or VNets.

**Example**:
```bicep
networkAcls: {
  bypass: 'AzureServices'
  defaultAction: 'Deny'
  ipRules: [
    { ipAddressOrRange: '203.0.113.0/24' }
  ]
  virtualNetworkRules: [
    { id: '/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<rg-name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnet-name>/subnets/<subnet-name>' }
  ]
}
```

---

## **3. Data Protection**

### **Enable Encryption**
- Ensure that data is encrypted at rest using **Microsoft-managed keys** or **customer-managed keys (CMK)** in Azure Key Vault.

**Example**:
```bicep
encryption: {
  services: {
    blob: { enabled: true }
    file: { enabled: true }
  }
  keySource: 'Microsoft.Keyvault'
  keyVaultProperties: {
    keyName: '<key-name>'
    keyVaultUri: '<key-vault-uri>'
  }
}
```

### **Enable Encryption in Transit**
- Enforce HTTPS for all connections to Azure Storage by setting `minimumTlsVersion` to `TLS1_2`.

**Example**:
```bicep
minimumTlsVersion: 'TLS1_2'
```

---

## **4. Monitoring and Threat Detection**

### **Enable Azure Monitor and Logs**
- Enable **Azure Monitor** and **Storage Analytics** to track access and usage patterns.
- Send logs to a **Log Analytics Workspace** for centralized monitoring.

### **Enable Azure Defender for Storage**
- Use **Azure Defender for Storage** to detect and respond to potential threats, such as unusual access patterns or malware.

---

## **5. Access Control Policies**

### **Use Azure RBAC**
- Assign granular permissions using built-in roles like `Storage Blob Data Reader` or `Storage Blob Data Contributor`.

### **Use Conditional Access Policies**
- Enforce **Conditional Access** policies to restrict access based on user location, device compliance, or risk level.

---

## **6. Secure Data Sharing**

### **Use SAS Tokens with Restrictions**
- If you must use **Shared Access Signatures (SAS)**, ensure they are time-limited and scoped to specific permissions.

**Example**:
- Limit SAS token permissions to `read` or `write` only.
- Restrict SAS token usage to specific IP ranges.

---

## **7. Backup and Recovery**

### **Enable Soft Delete**
- Enable **soft delete** for blobs, containers, and file shares to recover accidentally deleted data.

### **Enable Point-in-Time Restore**
- Use **point-in-time restore** for Azure Blob Storage to recover data to a previous state.

---

## **8. Example Bicep Configuration**
```bicep
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2022-09-01' = {
  name: storageAccountName
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
  properties: {
    allowBlobPublicAccess: false
    allowSharedKeyAccess: false
    minimumTlsVersion: 'TLS1_2'
    publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'
    networkAcls: {
      bypass: 'AzureServices'
      defaultAction: 'Deny'
      ipRules: [
        { ipAddressOrRange: '203.0.113.0/24' }
      ]
    }
    encryption: {
      services: {
        blob: { enabled: true }
        file: { enabled: true }
      }
      keySource: 'Microsoft.Keyvault'
      keyVaultProperties: {
        keyName: '<key-name>'
        keyVaultUri: '<key-vault-uri>'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
