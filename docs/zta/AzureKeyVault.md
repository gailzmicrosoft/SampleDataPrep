# Implementing Zero Trust Architecture for Azure Key Vault

<Draft> 
This guide outlines the key requirements and best practices for implementing Zero Trust Architecture for Azure Key Vault. The focus is on applying principles of least privilege, strong authentication, network segmentation, and continuous monitoring to securely manage secrets, certificates, and encryption keys.

## **1. Identity and Access Management**

### **Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for Authentication**
- Use **Azure AD identities** to authenticate users and applications accessing Azure Key Vault.
- Assign **Azure RBAC roles** to users, groups, or managed identities to enforce least privilege access.

### **Use Managed Identities**
- Use **Managed Identities** for applications and services to securely access Azure Key Vault without managing credentials.

### **Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Use **Azure RBAC** to manage access to Key Vault instead of traditional access policies for better integration with Azure AD.

---

## **2. Network Security**

### **Restrict Public Network Access**
- Disable public network access to the Key Vault unless absolutely necessary.
- Use **private endpoints** to securely connect to Azure Key Vault over a private network.

### **Enable Virtual Network Integration**
- Use **Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints** or **private endpoints** to restrict access to Azure Key Vault from specific VNets.

### **Firewall Rules**
- Configure **firewall rules** to allow access only from trusted IP ranges or VNets.

---

## **3. Data Protection**

### **Enable Encryption**
- Ensure that all secrets, certificates, and keys are encrypted at rest using **Microsoft-managed keys** or **customer-managed keys (CMK)**.

### **Use Key Rotation**
- Enable **automatic key rotation** for keys stored in Azure Key Vault to reduce the risk of key compromise.

### **Secure Sensitive Information**
- Store all sensitive information (e.g., connection strings, API keys) in Azure Key Vault.
- Avoid storing sensitive information in environment variables.

---

## **4. Monitoring and Threat Detection**

### **Enable Azure Monitor and Logs**
- Enable **Azure Monitor** to track access and usage patterns for Azure Key Vault.
- Send logs to a **Log Analytics Workspace** for centralized monitoring.

### **Enable Azure Defender for Key Vault**
- Use **Azure Defender for Key Vault** to detect and respond to potential threats, such as unauthorized access attempts.

---

## **5. Access Control Policies**

### **Use Azure RBAC**
- Assign granular permissions using built-in roles like `Key Vault Secrets User` or `Key Vault Administrator`.

### **Use Conditional Access Policies**
- Enforce **Conditional Access** policies to restrict access based on user location, device compliance, or risk level.

---

## **6. Secure Key and Secret Sharing**

### **Use Managed Identities for Applications**
- Use **Managed Identities** to securely access Azure Key Vault from applications without exposing credentials.

### **Limit Secret Access**
- Grant access to secrets only to the applications or users that require them.

---

## **7. Backup and Recovery**

### **Enable Soft Delete**
- Enable **soft delete** for Azure Key Vault to recover accidentally deleted secrets, certificates, or keys.

### **Enable Purge Protection**
- Enable **purge protection** to prevent permanent deletion of Key Vault items.

## **8. Bicep Example**
```bicep
resource keyVault 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2022-07-01' = {
  name: keyVaultName
  location: location
  properties: {
    tenantId: subscription().tenantId
    sku: {
      family: 'A'
      name: 'standard'
    }
    accessPolicies: []
    publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'
    networkAcls: {
      bypass: 'AzureServices'
      defaultAction: 'Deny'
      ipRules: [
        { ipAddressOrRange: '203.0.113.0/24' }
      ]
      virtualNetworkRules: [
        { id: '/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<rg-name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnet-name>/subnets/<subnet-name>' }
      ]
    }
  }
