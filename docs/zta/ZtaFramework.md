# Zero Trust Architecture Framework for Azure Applications

<Draft>
This guide outlines a comprehensive framework for implementing Zero Trust Architecture for Azure-based applications. The focus is on securing resources such as Azure Storage, Azure Container Apps, Azure PostgreSQL, Azure SQL DB, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Search, Azure Open AI, and Azure Cognitive Services by applying principles of least privilege, strong authentication, network segmentation, and continuous monitoring.

---

## **Core Principles of Zero Trust**
1. **Verify Explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points (e.g., user identity, location, device health, service identity).
2. **Use Least Privilege Access**: Limit access to only what is necessary for users, applications, and services.
3. **Assume Breach**: Design the architecture as if the network is already compromised.

## **Framework Layers**

### **1. Identity and Access Management**
- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**:
  - Centralize identity management for users, applications, and services.
  - Use **Conditional Access Policies** to enforce access restrictions based on risk levels, device compliance, and location.
  - Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all users.
- **Managed Identities**:
  - Use **System-Assigned** or **User-Assigned Managed Identities** for applications and services to securely access Azure resources without managing credentials.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Assign granular permissions using Azure RBAC roles for all resources.
  - Avoid assigning broad roles like `Owner` or `Contributor` unless absolutely necessary.

---

### **2. Network Security**
- **Private Endpoints**:
  - Use **Private Endpoints** to securely connect to Azure services (e.g., Storage, PostgreSQL, Cosmos DB) over a private network.
  - Disable public network access for all resources unless required.
- **Virtual Network (VNet) Integration**:
  - Integrate all resources (e.g., Azure Container Apps, Azure Functions) with a **Virtual Network**.
  - Use **VNet Service Endpoints** or **Private Link** for secure communication between resources.
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**:
  - Apply **NSGs** to subnets and VMs to restrict inbound and outbound traffic.
  - Allow only required ports and IP ranges.
- **Azure Firewall**:
  - Deploy **Azure Firewall** to inspect and filter traffic between VNets and the internet.
  - Use **Application Rules** to restrict outbound traffic to specific FQDNs (e.g., `*.database.windows.net` for Azure SQL).
- **DNS Security**:
  - Use **Azure Private DNS Zones** to resolve private endpoints within the VNet.
  - Disable public DNS resolution for sensitive resources.

---

### **3. Data Protection**
- **Encryption**:
  - Enable **encryption at rest** for all resources using **Microsoft-managed keys** or **customer-managed keys (CMK)** in Azure Key Vault.
  - Enforce **encryption in transit** by requiring HTTPS or SSL/TLS for all connections.
- **Azure Key Vault**:
  - Store secrets, certificates, and encryption keys in **Azure Key Vault**.
  - Use **Key Vault Access Policies** or **Azure RBAC** to control access.
- **Immutable Storage**:
  - Enable **immutable storage policies** for critical data to prevent tampering or deletion.
- **Backup and Recovery**:
  - Configure **automated backups** for databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL DB, Cosmos DB).
  - Enable **point-in-time restore** for critical data.

---

### **4. Monitoring and Threat Detection**
- **Azure Monitor**:
  - Enable **Azure Monitor** to collect metrics and logs for all resources.
  - Send logs to a **Log Analytics Workspace** for centralized monitoring.
- **Azure Defender**:
  - Enable **Azure Defender** for all supported resources (e.g., Storage, SQL, Cosmos DB, Kubernetes).
  - Use **Azure Defender for Containers** to scan container images for vulnerabilities.
- **Audit Logs**:
  - Enable **Activity Logs** and **Diagnostic Logs** for all resources.
  - Monitor access patterns and detect anomalies.
- **Threat Detection**:
  - Use **Azure Sentinel** for advanced threat detection and response.
  - Integrate with **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** for security recommendations.

---

### **5. Automation and Governance**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
  - Use **Bicep** or **Terraform** to define and deploy secure configurations for all resources.
  - Include security configurations (e.g., private endpoints, RBAC) in the IaC templates.
- **Azure Policy**:
  - Enforce compliance using **Azure Policy**.
  - Example policies:
    - Require private endpoints for all resources.
    - Enforce encryption with customer-managed keys.
    - Deny public network access.
- **DevSecOps**:
  - Integrate security checks into the CI/CD pipeline.
  - Use tools like **Azure DevOps** or **GitHub Actions** to automate deployments.

---

## **Resource-Specific Zero Trust Configurations**

### **1. Azure Storage**
- Disable public access and shared key authentication.
- Use private endpoints and VNet integration.
- Store secrets in Azure Key Vault.

### **2. Azure Container Apps**
- Disable public ingress and use private endpoints.
- Store sensitive information in Azure Key Vault.
- Enable Azure Defender for Containers.

### **3. Azure PostgreSQL and SQL DB**
- Enforce SSL connections.
- Use private endpoints and firewall rules.
- Enable automated backups and point-in-time restore.

### **4. Azure Cosmos DB**
- Enable private endpoints and disable public access.
- Use RBAC for granular access control.
- Enable Azure Defender for Cosmos DB.

### **5. Azure Open AI and Cognitive Services**
- Use private endpoints for secure access.
- Restrict access using Azure AD and RBAC.
- Monitor usage with Azure Monitor.

## **Key Concepts for Implementation**
1. **Start with Identity**: Secure all resources with Azure AD and managed identities.
2. **Segment the Network**: Use VNets, NSGs, and private endpoints to isolate resources.
3. **Encrypt Everything**: Ensure encryption at rest and in transit for all data.
4. **Monitor Continuously**: Use Azure Monitor, Defender, and Sentinel for real-time insights.
5. **Automate Compliance**: Use Azure Policy and IaC to enforce security configurations.
