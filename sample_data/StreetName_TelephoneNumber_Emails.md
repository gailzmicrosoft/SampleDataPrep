## Guidelines for sample street addresses, telephone numbers, and emails for sample data generation 



- **Street addresses**: you should use sequential numbers, common street names, and incorrect zip codes (e.g., 4567 Main St Buffalo, NY 98052).

- **Telephone numbers**: in the United States, the phone number 555-0100 to 555-0199 may be used with any North American area code (except 800, 866, 877, 888, or 900).  International phone numbers should use sequential numbers.
